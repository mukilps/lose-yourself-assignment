        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>Here are the official lyrics of "Lose Yourself" by Eminem:</p>
        <pre>

            Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
            To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
            Would you capture it or just let it slip?
            Yo


            His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
            He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
            He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
            He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
            The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
            Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
            Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
            But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
            He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
            He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
            He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
            Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
            Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


            You better lose yourself in the music
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
            You better lose yourself in the music
            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
            You better
